# Level 200 - Add Search

1. Complete all requirements from Level 100
1. Add a "live" search input:
   1. Only episodes whose `summary` **OR** `name` contains the search term should be displayed
   1. The search should be case-**in**sensitive
   1. The display should update **immediately** after each keystroke changes the input.
   1. Display how many episodes match the current search
   1. If the search box is cleared, **all** episodes should be shown.

## Example screenshot of search

Note: Provided your project meets the above requirements, it can **look** however you want.

Here is one example layout.
